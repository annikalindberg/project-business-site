Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

Practice Javascript by doing a form and a FAQ. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We decided what the form should be and wanted to have several different functions and elements. We used HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was fun to try mob programming and I think we could contribute a lot each of us. With more time I think we should have planned the project more.
